With a populated "Default Pod" the next step would be to use UCS Director to orchestrate and automate your infrastructure with policies and workflows (using built-in and custom tasks). As well UCS Director functionality can be extended using it's "Open Automation SDK", "PowerShell Console", and REST API.

This lab is an introduction to UCS Director.

## Objectives

Completion time: 20 minutes

  - What is UCS Director
  - Login to UCS Director
  - Add a Site for Default Pod
  - Add a vCenter for Default Pod
  - Add an ACI APIC for Default Pod
  - View Virtualization, Compute, and Network Components of Default Pod

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of UCS Director is useful but not necessary. Other than that a desire to learn is all you need to bring with you.

## UCS Director

Cisco UCS Director is a complete, highly secure, end-to-end management, orchestration, and automation solution for a wide array of Cisco and non-Cisco data center infrastructure components, and for the industry's leading converged infrastructure solutions based on the Cisco UCS and Cisco Nexus platforms. For a complete list of supported infrastructure components and solutions, see the [Cisco UCS Director Compatibility Matrix](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/ucs-director/products-device-support-tables-list.html).

Cisco UCS Director is a 64-bit appliance that uses the following standard templates:

  - Open Virtualization Format (OVF) for VMware vSphere
  - Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) for Microsoft Hyper-V

Cisco UCS Director extends the unification of computing and network layers through Cisco UCS to provide you with comprehensive visibility and management of your data center infrastructure components. You can use Cisco UCS Director to configure, administer, and monitor supported Cisco and non-Cisco components. The tasks you can perform include the following:

  - Create, clone, and deploy service profiles and templates for all Cisco UCS servers and compute applications.
  - Monitor organizational usage, trends, and capacity across a converged infrastructure on a continuous basis.
  - Deploy and add capacity to converged infrastructures in a consistent, repeatable manner.
  - Manage, monitor, and report on data center components, such as Cisco UCS domains or Cisco Nexus network devices.
  - Extend virtual service catalogs to include services for your physical infrastructure.
  - Manage secure multi-tenant environments to accommodate virtualized workloads that run with non-virtualized workloads.

# *** Before You Begin ***

The **admin** user password for UCS Director may have expired. In order to complete this lab and other UCS Director labs in this module the **admin** user password will need to be **reset**. The reset of the admin user password is done by logging into UCS Director CLI interface as the root user and running the password reset script.

The password will be immediately reset to **admin**. If the admin user is denied access using the password **admin** then a restart of the UCS Director Services is required.

  - ***Enter*** "y" at the `Do you want to stop database [y/n]? : ` prompt

  - ***Press*** `return` to return to the `shelladmin` menu when indicated.

  - ***Enter*** "6" at the `SELECT> ` prompt to `Start Database`

  - ***Press*** `return` to return to the `shelladmin` menu when indicated.

  - ***Enter*** "4" at the `SELECT> ` prompt to `Start Services`

  - ***Press*** `return` to return to the `shelladmin` menu when indicated.

  To check the state of the UCS Director Services restart use option 2 from the `shelladmin` menu

  - ***Enter*** "2" at the `SELECT> ` prompt

  - ***View*** the `Services State`

  - ***Press*** `return` to return to the `shelladmin` menu when indicated.

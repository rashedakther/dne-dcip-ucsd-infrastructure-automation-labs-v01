# Mission: Using the UCS Director REST API to Execute Workflows and View their Status

Take what you've learned about UCS Director from the Learning Labs and put that knowledge to use to Execute a Workflow and Monitor its' status via the REST API.

## Objectives

Completion time: 25 minutes

  - Import Workflow
  - Execute Workflow
    - Find the API call in the REST API Browser
    - Call the API and Execute the Workflow
  - Check the status of the Workflow
    - Find the API call in the REST API Browser
    - Call the API and view the status of the Workflow

## Prerequisites

Knowing a bit about UCS Director and REST APIs helps, and since you've most likely completed the Full Infrastructure Automation with UCS Director Learning Labs you are all set and ready to go.

# Exercise 1
Launch UCS Director and Import a Workflow

The workflow that you are importing has a single purpose, to take any MAC Address in the form **00:25:B5:00:00:00**, for example, and convert it to **00-25-B5-00-00-00**.

The import has two components a workflow and a custom task.

1. Launch UCS Director

    - Import Workflow
      ```code
      C:\Users\demouser\CiscoDevNet\code\LM-5701 ucsd api\dne-dcip-ucsd-infrastructure-automation-api-mission.wfdx
      ```  
      - Accept all defaults
      - Verify that the workflow "Mac_Converter_v1_0" was added to "Workflows" in the "Justice Team" folder
      - Verify that the Custom Task "Mac_Converter_v1" was added to "Custom Workflow Tasks"

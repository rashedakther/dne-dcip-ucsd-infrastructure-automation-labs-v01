### Exercise 2

Use a REST API call to execute the workflow.

The workflow `Mac_Converter_v1_0` has a single parameter that takes a single value.

  - `mac`: **00:25:B5:00:00:00**
    - The workflow accepts an input called **mac**. It is important to note that a workflow can request multiple inputs that can be used throughout the workflow process. The names of the inputs to the workflow *do not* have to match the name of the inputs to the tasks that the workflow utilizes.
  - Workflow and Task input names are case-sensitive.

1. Find the REST API call in the REST API Browser
  - Click the down-facing arrow on the right of the screen and select **REST API Browser**
  - Search for the call `UserAPIGlobal@userAPISubmitWorkflowServiceRequest`
  - Generate the REST API URL
  - Update the URL with the correct parameters:
    - `param0`: Name of Workflow
      - **Mac_Converter_v1_0**
    - `param1`: Input parameters
      - **"name":"mac","value":"00:25:B5:00:00:00"**
    - `param2`: Parent Service Request ID
      - **-1** (-1 indicates that there is not a parent SR)
  - Execute the URL via Postman, get the REST API Key first
    - Add the **X-Cloupia-Request-Key** Header
    - API Call **getRESTKey**
      - `user`: **admin**
      - `password`: **C1sco12345**
      - `/app/api/rest?opName=getRESTKey&user=admin&password=C1sco12345`
